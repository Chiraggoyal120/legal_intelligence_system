# Legal Intelligence Agentic System
**Hannoworks Internship Assignment - AI-Powered Legal Analysis Platform**

## 🏛️ Overview

The Legal Intelligence Agentic System is a sophisticated AI-powered platform designed to analyze complex legal cases, retrieve relevant precedents, and provide comprehensive legal reasoning. Built with a multi-agent architecture, the system specializes in Indian constitutional law and privacy rights cases.

### Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Specialized agents for web scraping, legal reasoning, argument generation, and verdict prediction
- **RAG Pipeline**: Advanced retrieval-augmented generation using FAISS vector search and SentenceTransformer embeddings
- **Legal Precedent Analysis**: Comprehensive database of landmark Indian Supreme Court judgments
- **Dual-Side Arguments**: Generates compelling legal arguments for both petitioner and respondent
- **Verdict Prediction**: AI-powered outcome prediction with confidence scoring
- **Interactive Interface**: User-friendly Gradio web interface with sample cases

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- OpenRouter API key (for LLM access)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chiraggoyal120/legal-intelligence-system.git
cd legal-intelligence-system
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-openrouter-api-key-here"
```

### Running the System

1. **Command Line Execution**:
```bash
python legal_intelligence_system.py
```

2. **Jupyter Notebook**:
```bash
jupyter notebook demo.ipynb
```

3. **Access the Web Interface**:
   - Open your browser to `http://localhost:7860`
   - Or use the public Gradio link when running in Colab

## 📊 System Architecture

### Multi-Agent Components

1. **WebScraper Agent**: Collects and structures legal documents from various sources
2. **VectorDatabase**: FAISS-based semantic search over legal precedents
3. **LegalReasoningAgent**: Analyzes precedents and extracts legal principles
4. **ArgumentGenerationAgent**: Creates compelling arguments for both sides
5. **VerdictPredictionAgent**: Predicts likely outcomes with confidence metrics

### Technology Stack

- **LLM**: Mistral-7B-Instruct via OpenRouter API
- **Vector Search**: FAISS with all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embeddings
- **Web Interface**: Gradio with custom theming
- **Async Processing**: asyncio for concurrent operations
- **Data Processing**: pandas, numpy, BeautifulSoup

## 💼 Use Cases

### 1. Privacy Rights Analysis (2025 Scenario)
**Query**: Government policy mandating biometric data collection for public services

**System Output**:
- Retrieves Puttaswamy (2017) privacy judgment
- Analyzes Aadhaar constitutional validity cases
- Generates arguments for both citizen privacy and government security
- Predicts likely court restrictions with 78% confidence

### 2. Freedom of Expression
**Query**: Social media content regulation policies

**System Output**:
- References Shreya Singhal vs Union of India
- Analyzes Section 66A constitutional challenges
- Evaluates chilling effect on free speech
- Suggests balanced approach with judicial safeguards

### 3. Digital Rights
**Query**: Mandatory digital identity systems

**System Output**:
- Cites Aadhaar validity precedents
- Examines choice vs compulsion debate
- Proposes conditional validity with opt-out mechanisms

## 🎯 Sample Usage

### Basic Query Processing
```python
# Initialize the system
legal_system = LegalIntelligenceSystem(OPENROUTER_API_KEY)
await legal_system.initialize()

# Process a legal query
query = "Government mandating biometric data for public services violates privacy rights"
context = "Citizens challenge policy under Article 21 constitutional protection"
result = await legal_system.process_legal_query(query, context)

# Access results
print(f"Precedents: {len(result['precedents'])}")
print(f"Confidence: {result['verdict_prediction']['confidence']:.1%}")
```

### Web Interface Usage
1. Enter your legal query in the text area
2. Provide additional case context (optional)
3. Click "🔍 Analyze Case"
4. Review the comprehensive analysis across four sections:
   - Relevant Precedents
   - Legal Analysis  
   - Legal Arguments (Both Sides)
   - Verdict Prediction

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`: Your OpenRouter API key for LLM access
- `MODEL_NAME`: LLM model name (default: mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct)

### System Parameters
- **Embedding Model**: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (384 dimensions)
- **Vector Search**: FAISS IndexFlatIP for cosine similarity
- **Retrieval**: Top-3 most relevant precedents
- **LLM Temperature**: 0.7 for balanced creativity and accuracy

## 📈 Performance Metrics

- **Response Time**: < 30 seconds for complete analysis
- **Precedent Retrieval**: < 2 seconds vector search
- **Legal Reasoning**: ~15 seconds for comprehensive analysis
- **Argument Generation**: ~10 seconds per side
